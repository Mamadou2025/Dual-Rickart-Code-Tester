        "Checking the Dual Rickart and Baer Properties for Semimodules. The Google Colab notebook associated with this study provides a complete implementation of the algorithm used to test the dual weak Rickart property for semimodules defined over the natural numbers with the GCD operation. The notebook allows the user to input a natural number n, generate all valid endomorphisms on the finite set M = {0, 1, ..., n}, analyze their algebraic properties, and determine whether the structure satisfies the dual weak Rickart condition. The computational process includes checking for idempotency, computing the kernel, direct image, extended image, and i-regularity of each function. Since the number of possible functions increases exponentially with n, the runtime and performance of the notebook are dependent on the computational resources provided by Google Colab. Here's a concise summary of the pseudocode: Algorithm Overview: Input: A non-negative integer n defines the set M = {0, 1, ..., n}. Output: A list of valid endomorphisms on M, their algebraic properties, and whether M satisfies the dual weak Rickart property. Steps:\n",
